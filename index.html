        <h2>HOMEPAGE</h2>
        <h3>What is the Premier League?</h3>
        <p>The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL outside England,
        is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of
        promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). The Premier League is a corporation in
        which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches
        (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
        The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border
        league.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of
        clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888,
        and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1 billion a year
        domestically as of 2013–14, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38
        games respectively. The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international
        television rights. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17,
        with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs. Forty-nine
        clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. Six of them have won the title
        since then: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (4), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers
        (1), and Leicester City (1). The record of most points in a Premier League season is 100, set by
        Manchester City in 2017–18.</p>
        <h3>Viewership</h3>
        <p>The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to
        643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season average
        Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated
        attendance across all matches is the highest of any league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies
        are near capacity.</p>

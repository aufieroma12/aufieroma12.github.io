                <p>And should they leave Selhurst Park with at least a point, their 30-match run
                would make them one of only five teams to go unbeaten for so long in the Premier League.</p>

                heard first-hand about the horrors of the Holocaust as survivors visited them and shared their stories.</p>
                <p>Ivor Perl went to Chelsea's Cobham training academy and told them about how, at the age of 12, he was taken to a concentration camp and was one of only two survivors from his family of nine.</p>
                <p>Perl stressed to Chelsea's Under-15s the importance of showing love, not hate, towards one another.</p>
                <p>"Football is such an exposed sport, and you can have an awful lot of say in your life," Perl told Chelsea's official website.</p>
                <p>"All of you know what hate can do, and I've proven to myself many times that love will get you a lot further than hate."</p>
                <p>The visit also supported Chelsea's "Say No to Antisemitism" campaign, which raises awareness and educates the club's players, staff and fans about prejudice against Jewish people in football and wider society.</p>
                <p>Perl's visit came before Chelsea's Under-15s visited the Auschwitz concentration camp as part of the Premier League's educational visit to Poland after they had won the League's Under-14 International Tournament last season.</p>

                <p>Jamie Vardy leads with 11 goals.

                in Matchweek 13.</p>
                <p>He could come head-to-head at Etihad Stadium with another contender in Sergio Aguero, who won the prize in 2014/15 with 26 goals. The Argentinian has the best minutes-per-goal record of this season's top six scorers.</p>
                <p>Joint-winner of last season's prize, <a class="team" href="https://www.arsenal.com/?utm_source=premier-league-website&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=link">Arsenal's</a>
                Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is three goals behind but next up he can look forward to facing a <a class="team" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=47&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjD0-3ymPLlAhWLjFkKHY8YB9oQ-TAoADAuegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsouthamptonfc.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2QGS5p8-TPppCE6Q_rWNlz">Southampton</a>

                <p>Sadio Mane also shared the 2018/19 award and he staked his claims to lift it again with a goal in <a class= "team" href="http://www.liverpoolfc.com/?utm_source=premier-league-website&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=link?utm_source=premier-league-website&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=link">Liverpool's</a>

                <p>Two-time winners Mohamed Salah and Kane are among four players still in contention on six goals, so do not discount them yet.</p>
